# Academic Report Abstract Generator (ARAG)
**Authors**: Dan Christiani, Cody Smith

ARAG is an Academic Report Abstract Generator, which trains on a corpus of abstracts from a given domain and generates new abstracts for reports in that domain.

###Abstract
Academic reports are extremely important and often serious documents. They report findings in an organized and referenceable way to inform, record, and shape our understanding of our world. For each domain of study, there are common structures in syntax and overall flow of the article, and specifically the abstract. For this reason we will attempt to do a meta-analysis of academic papers and their abstracts in an effort to uncover the unlayering structure, syntactic preferences, and vocabulary of a given subdomain and author of an academic community. These statistics will be used to generate a convincing academic abstract for a given domain in LaTeX or HTML format via a python algorithm. The algorithm will use a variety of natural language techniques including context-free grammar, n-gram analysis, and grammar equivalency to fill in a predetermined learned structure for an abstract in that domain. Related works include the SCIgen automatic computer science paper generator, which has successfully generated papers which were accepted at several conferences at the expense of organizers. A successful generated abstract will be syntactically correct and readable without human intervention while still generating unique talking points on collected data from a single author and/or domain. We will as a group evaluate the resulting papers based on the grammatical correctness, semantic sense, and tone.
