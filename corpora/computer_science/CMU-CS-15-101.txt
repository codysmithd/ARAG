Comingle is a logic programming framework aimed at simplifying the development of applications distributed over multiple mobile devices. Applications are written as a single declarative program (in a system-centric way) rather than in the traditional node-centric manner, where separate communicating code is written for each participating node. Comingle is based on committed-choice multiset rewriting and is founded on linear logic. We describe a prototype targeting the Android operating system and illustrate how Comingle is used to program distributed mobile applications. As a proof of concept, we discuss three distributed mobile games and one networking service orchestrated using Comingle.
