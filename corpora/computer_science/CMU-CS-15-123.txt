The notion of cloudlet is getting widely accepted from both academia and industry. However, the development of the cloudlet faces a classic bootstrapping problem. It needs practical applications to incentivize cloudlet deployment while developers cannot heavily rely on a cloudlet infrastructure until they are widely deployed. To provide a systematic way to expedite cloudlet deployment, I implemented OpenStack++ that extends OpenStack, an open source ecosystem for cloud computing. In this work, I present design decisions to efficiently integrate cloudlets with OpenStack and show implementation details for VM provisioning and handoff. Finally, I explain how I resolved practical challenges for the cloudlet porting.
