Nanoscale SRAM memory design has become increasingly challenging due to the reducing noise margins and increased sensitivity to threshold voltage variations. These issues oppose our ability to achieve stable bitcells and acceptable performance while maintaining density using the standard six-transistor(6T) circuit. To overcome these challenges, researchers have proposed different topologies for SRAMs with single-ended 8T, 9T, 10T bitcell designs. These designs improve the cell stability in the subthreshold regime but suffer from bit-line leakage noise, placing constraints on the number of cells shared by each bitline. In this paper, we propose a novel 9T SRAM cell topology which achieves both cell stability as well as prevents bit-line leakage. With the proposed 9T SRAM circuit, the read static noise margin is nearly twice that of conventional 6T SRAM circuit. Furthermore, the bitline leakage power consumption of the proposed 9T SRAM cell is reduced by up to 79%, 76% and 39% when compared to the previously published 8T, 10T and 9T SRAM cells, respectively.
