High power densities and operating temperatures in multi-processor systems impose a number of undesirable effects, including performance degradation, high operational and cooling costs, and reliability deterioration leading to system failures. Many-core systems bring exciting opportunities in design and system management owing to the ample hardware parallelism, while introducing novel challenges due to their complexity and the highly variant workload that is expected to run on these systems. Efficient thermal monitoring and management, designing thermally-aware architectures, and multi-level parameter optimization can alleviate some of the undesirable thermal effects while maintaining the desired performance and energy levels. In particular, these techniques aid in the evolution of green computing systems. This chapter provides a qualitative discussion on thermal management techniques for many-core systems. We will elucidate the following questions in detail: What are the specific design challenges in monitoring the temperature of large-scale systems? How can we exploit the multi-level optimizations at runtime in response to the dynamic behavior of the processorâ€™s workload? How do emerging workloads affect the thermal distribution on many-core systems?
